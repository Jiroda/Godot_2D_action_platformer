Flexible state machine controlled action platformer

To-do (would be awesome for some help there):    
* stick to moving platform - has some lag behind behaviour;
* add option to jump down on one-way platform;
* add slope movement;
* maybe add special collision group for allowing climbing and for wallslide.
